  # While it would be nice to re-use the autohttps class, we want to expose multiple
  # endpoints on this host (Prometheus and Alertmanager, at least) which means
  # proxying from port 443 to the correct endpoint becomes a challenge.
  # Particularly because Prometheus and Alertmanager link to themselves in some
  # way and there is not always an easy way to update that link to point to
  # nginx instead.
  # While we could separate our services across multiple hosts to address this
  # issue, we only want to maintain a single host for Prometheus for now.
